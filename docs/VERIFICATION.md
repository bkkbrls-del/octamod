# Verification record

## Browser firmware flow — 1 October 2026

Verified in the actual local frontend using the browser worker and a locally saved original OS 1.40C file. Stock and output bytes stayed local; this record contains identities only.

| Configuration | Stock FX2 | Download bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Mini Verb, Tape Echo, Euclid, Repitch | retained | 582260 | `91331100c6035b9961fa55c9757b6132eebb0c5b773c1d918052f08b558a78b0` |
| Spectrum, Modulation, Character, Mini Verb, Tape Echo, Euclid, Repitch | compact | 590072 | `1f5050c1ef1f0bc632bd354410be18d151828312f0d80cdafe2a21c4a02feb0d` |

Both identities equal the unchanged native builder plus the same-input native ELEK/ELUP packaging oracle at source revision `b8deefc88b2c3e5f3c6158e364eb741df1924e1d`. See `src/engine/assets/composition-proofs.json`; eight native profiles have OS, container and full-file fingerprints. All seven modules with all stock FX2 effects are rejected for formatter-cave overflow by both composers. The browser reports how to reduce that selection and offers no download.

Risk acknowledgement gates the build. Changing chooser settings invalidates the completed result and acknowledgement. Canceling a real compact build returns to the valid selection; the next build completes with the native identity above. The enabled Download .bin control was clicked in the actual browser. The downloaded file was independently read from the host Downloads folder: 590072 bytes with SHA-256 `1f5050c1ef1f0bc632bd354410be18d151828312f0d80cdafe2a21c4a02feb0d`, matching both the browser result and native oracle. Changing chooser settings afterwards removed the old download and acknowledgement; the overflowing selection remained blocked. Restoring the workspace reverifies the locally saved base. No native emulator, stress or audio-render checks were run for this verification.

Local parity and container round-trip checks do **not** qualify this catalog on hardware. Current module-specific limitations remain visible. Download is enabled for the supported fixed catalog and chooser profiles; arbitrary custom choosers and unapproved third-party packages remain unsupported.

## Application checks

`npm run check` passed lint, 113 tests in 26 files, TypeScript app/server checks and the static production build on 1 October 2026, before the SDK import. Further changes require a new check.

## Still required before completion

first-time base selection and rejection in the browser; project-path frontend and separate-origin guest API and administrator access verification; responsive and keyboard coverage across routes; a clean SDK developer setup; approved source-to-package publication; actual licensed screenshots/audio where available; production service configuration. No public deployment has occurred.


## Source-folder catalog and versions — 1 October 2026

The frontend now reads strict versioned manifests beside the seven imported source modules. `npm run check` passed 115 tests in 27 files, lint, TypeScript and static build after version pins were added. An independent disposable Git fixture proved that a README update without a version increase is rejected, and a greater semantic version plus exact catalog pin is accepted. The SDK scaffolder successfully created a disposable DSP module; the source skeleton is explicitly untested. Local community migrations 0004–0006 applied successfully. Source-to-package release automation and portable developer setup remain incomplete; the platform migration now has the separate parity evidence below.

Guest comment posting and the ownership-only Remove control were exercised in the actual browser against the local bearer-session Worker; the verification comment was removed afterwards. Existing guest rating/like state was retained. Worker dry-run bundling passed (77.69 KiB, 19.19 KiB gzip) without deployment.

## Trimmed SDK composition — 1 October 2026

The public SDK registry contains exactly the seven frontend modules. Two stock-loader declarations are isolated under `sdk/octabam/platform/`, with their controller dependencies outside the catalog. The stock null routine is absent from the source tree: the assembler reserves its nine-word tail and fills it from locally fingerprinted original firmware, with the loop end relocated. Stock detour/DSP-hook expectations likewise use guarded local reads.

In a disposable SDK copy using the same patched assembler/linker, Mini Verb + Tape Echo + Euclid + Repitch with stock FX2 produced 1,245,104 bytes, SHA-256 `1dbef0e5646ae3814224b88ca6ebda7fb911840a8ca2aa2af810ed5ef5e0cdac`. All seven modules with the compact FX2 chooser produced 1,250,126 bytes, SHA-256 `5162680d8bc342deb623cef00307f2a343f539a90f0bfcef59b59ceb4c60bb83`. Both complete native-image identities equal the unchanged upstream-source oracle. All seven with stock FX2 rejected with the same `wide dial hook (116 B) does not fit` error. Raw composed image sizes differ from the compressed downloadable upgrade sizes recorded above.

Temporary stock-containing inputs and outputs were removed. No emulator, stress or render checks ran. Reproduce with `scripts/verify-sdk-native.py`; hashes and scope are recorded in `sdk/verification.json`. Native setup portability, remaining source/provenance audit and reviewed source-to-package release automation remain required.

The full lightweight application check passed 116 tests in 28 files, lint, TypeScript and static build. Three additional synthetic SDK tests passed missing/altered-input rejection, bounds/fingerprint validation and native DSP record recovery without proprietary fixtures. Both DSP and ColdFire scaffolds were created and checked; they retain author attribution and a deliberate failing qualification gate until actual behavior checks are implemented.

## Guest-only community and separate administration — 1 October 2026

Website GitHub sign-in was removed: no OAuth routes, grants, callback cookies, GitHub identity in the session contract, or frontend sign-in code remain. Former `/api/auth/github`, `/callback` and `/complete` return 410 without redirects or cookies. Account-bound cloud configuration copies are retired (410); configurations stay on the device and move by export. Migration 0007 drops the one-use grant table and adds administrator sessions.

Administration is separate from guest identity. The backend owner configures `ADMIN_KEY_SHA256`; the administrator exchanges the key for an eight-hour, tab-scoped session sent in `X-Octamod-Admin`. Every `/api/admin/` route checks it on the server. Without a valid configured digest, access fails closed. Key attempts are throttled, sign-out revokes the session and rotating the key revokes all sessions. Issue reports, comment moderation and history are only under `/api/admin/`; reporters see their own reports through `/api/issues/mine`.

`npm run check` passed 125 tests in 30 files (including the four owner-merge approval tests and new administrator/guest isolation tests), the four synthetic SDK tests, lint, app/server TypeScript and the static build. Against the actual local Worker runtime (workerd) the retired routes returned 410, admin routes 403 and an unconfigured key 503. A disposable second Worker with its own D1 state and a temporary key accepted the correct key, refused a wrong one, kept a guest out of the admin inbox, showed the reporter only their own report and refused the revoked session. The temporary key and state were deleted. The new pages were not yet exercised in a browser.

## Source-built packages v4 — 1 October 2026

Native parity found a regression in the v3 source build. v3 bound the receiver's static null dispatch entries to its local stub copy (`dlstubinit`) instead of stock's null stub (`P:0x7c8` A / `P:0x588` B), so the patched OS extent no longer matched the native oracle. The SDK's dynamic-load notes state that static placement keeps the stock entries and only the running receiver redirects ids. A controlled A/B run showed v2 assets and v3 with only those two values restored both pass full parity.

The compiler now takes the static entries from the declared stock-copy source address, and `--verify-existing` compares the complete receiver record (placement, frame, dispatch bindings, stock-copy record and code), not only code bytes. The importer independently refuses receivers that rebind static null entries. v4 was compiled stock-free with the read-only native toolchain against the parity-proven v2 baseline. Its resident receiver file is byte-identical to v2; the ROM file differs from v2 only in the shared-dial guard source fingerprint. Source tree `d7a156941589e867236a470adc5fccb6c03a513d98bd7ae092ea3df17097c213`, compiler `36265406504e8e1d4bcaac1534ff5ecf3f639a6f854cebbfc044a167f1785bf5`, development build (no source commit or approval).

The import rejection proof accepted v4 and refused corrupt, stale-version, stale-source, incomplete-inventory, stock-read, non-zero stock-tail and null-rebinding artifacts without changing frontend assets; v3 is now refused because its compiler differs. After importing v4, `scripts/verify-composition-native.mjs` with the user's own original 1.40C matched all eight native OS, container and update identities, including 590072 B (all seven, compact) and 582260 B (four modules, stock FX2), plus the crowded-selection, wrong-slot, unsupported-chooser and modified-firmware rejections. No firmware was written. A stock-free copy of the v4 artifact and the proof script are kept locally under `.codex/source-builds/` (not tracked). No emulator, stress or render checks ran.

## Release pipeline review — 1 October 2026

The repository is now public at `repeat98/octamod`. The first push ran `pages.yml` and failed closed at the owner-merge step because `MODULE_APPROVER_GITHUB_ID` is not configured; nothing was built or deployed and Pages is not enabled. That run also showed the release scripts load their TypeScript helpers on the runner's Node 24 before `npm ci`. GitHub's REST API lists `2026-03-10` as a supported version, so the approval client's version header is valid.

Changes from the review: the six workflow actions are pinned to the commit SHAs of their current releases (checkout 7.0.1, setup-node 7.0.0, upload-artifact 7.0.1, download-artifact 8.0.1, upload-pages-artifact 5.0.0, deploy-pages 5.0.1; all Node 24 or composite, with the inputs used verified at those commits). Runners are pinned to `ubuntu-24.04`, and the toolchain image to the `ubuntu:24.04` index digest. The ineffective second `.dockerignore` was removed; `Dockerfile.dockerignore` is the one Docker applies. Release-mode import now also requires the CI build to reproduce the committed, locally parity-verified packages, with the commit stamp as the only permitted difference. Before this, CI-compiled bytes replaced the committed ones without any parity evidence.

A disposable clone with these changes committed exercised the real `build-modules-isolated.sh` with a stand-in for `docker run` (no daemon was available). It refused a mutable image tag, an existing output directory and a dirty checkout. The staged mount contained exactly the commit's tracked tree, one commit object and no history. Planted ignored files (`firmware/fake.bin`, `.dev.vars`) were absent. The compiler's release-mode Git checks passed on the read-only staged copy. With GitHub's API mocked, the production importer refused a merge by another account, a non-matching merge commit and a committed package that the build did not reproduce. It accepted the owner-merged, reproducible build and recorded the PR approval. The eight published packages differ from the committed v4 packages only in `sourceCommit`.

Still unverified: the Docker image build and real container isolation (network, capabilities, read-only root); whether the container's Ubuntu `binutils-m68k-linux-gnu` and its dsp56300 build reproduce the local packages (the reproduction gate fails closed if not); and a real owner-merged PR run on GitHub with Pages enabled.

The first owner-merged PR (#1, merge commit `3f68473`) showed that GitHub omits `merge_commit_sha` from the single-PR endpoint for read-only tokens. The release check therefore refused a genuine owner merge, twice, and published nothing. Approval now requires GitHub's own `merged` issue event to name this exact commit and the owner as the merging account, keeps every other PR check, and still compares `merge_commit_sha` whenever GitHub returns it. Because a push can start the check seconds before GitHub links the merge commit to its PR, the lookup retries for about 90 seconds. Against the live API without a token, the check approved `3f68473` as PR #1 merged by the owner and refused the PR's head commit.

The first release run past the approval check (merge of #2) built the image and compiled the DSP packages, then failed on ColdFire assembly. Ubuntu 24.04's `binutils-m68k-linux-gnu` is older than the local GNU binutils 2.47 (`m68k-elf`) that produced the committed packages and lacks the `.base64` directive. Nothing was published. The image now builds binutils 2.47 for `m68k-elf` from `binutils-2.47.tar.xz`, pinned by SHA-256 `154ab23b60070e8f27013c22977f1129425d67d1e8acd6e13010e617811e4cff`. The tarball was verified locally as signed by the chief binutils maintainer's key in GNU's official keyring.

With Docker running locally (linux/arm64; GitHub's runners are x86-64), the image built and the real `build-modules-isolated.sh` compiled a clean clone of main (`83c2ee9`) in the container. All eight packages are identical to the committed, parity-verified packages apart from `sourceCommit`. The production importer, with GitHub's API mocked and `merge_commit_sha` withheld, accepted them. With the script's flags, the container had no network route, a read-only root filesystem, a non-root user and only `/tmp` writable.

## Production deployment — 1 October 2026

The merge of #3 ran the complete release workflow: owner merge verified, isolated container compile, reproduction gate, app check and Pages deployment. https://octamod.app serves the site over HTTPS with a GitHub-issued certificate. `www.octamod.app` and `repeat98.github.io/octamod` redirect to it. The live firmware worker carries the approval record for PR #3 (commit `c2f5c5b`, merged by the owner) with the qualification note "assembly and relocation only".

The community Worker runs at `https://octamod-community.octamod.workers.dev` with a new D1 database (Western Europe) and migrations 0001–0007. It has no R2 binding. Against the live API: the session route answered for `https://octamod.app`, another origin was refused (403), the preflight from `https://octamod.app` was allowed, module data was readable, admin routes were refused (403), admin login reported "not configured" (503) before the key was set, and the retired sign-in routes returned 410.

## Firmware downloads paused — 1 October 2026

After the site went live, the owner loaded a downloaded image (Mini Verb, Tape Echo, Euclid and Repitch) in octemu, and selecting an FX showed "DSP LOAD FAILED". With stock FX2 kept, that selection is a native parity profile: the browser output is byte-identical to native octabam at the pinned revision `b8deefc`. Upstream recorded the same message on 30 September, after that revision, as an open failure on branch `build/abd-packages` (commit `7b055186`). On a tester's real unit, an image with the dynamic DSP loader, Tape Echo, Mini Verb and Euclid showed DSP LOAD FAILED on every FX, played no audio and stayed on step 1; the same image without the loader played. Upstream's conclusion is that the loader must not ship in a flashable image until its transport is proven on a chip. Every image Octamod composes contains that loader, so downloads are paused: building still checks a configuration, but no file is offered. Re-enable only after a fix is verified on hardware and brought in through a new pinned revision with renewed parity proofs.

## Frontend-only releases — 1 October 2026

The release workflow now rebuilds module packages only when module source, the compiler, the release scripts or the committed packages changed since the last successful release. It compares against the last success, not the previous commit, so a failed module build cannot be skipped by a later merge. Otherwise `scripts/stamp-module-build.mjs` checks the committed packages against their record, the module source fingerprint and the compiler hash, then records the owner-merge approval for the commit. Under bash, the change check chose a full rebuild for this change (it touches the release scripts) and the fast path for `main`. In a fresh clone, with GitHub mocked, the stamp refused changed module source, a changed package and a changed compiler, and accepted the unchanged tree.

This exposed that local builds counted macOS `.DS_Store` files as module source, so the committed record's fingerprint did not match the Git tree. The compiler and the shared inventory now ignore them. The rebuilt packages (v5) are byte-identical to v4, so native parity is unchanged, and the committed fingerprint `994e2a69…` now equals the one the CI build recorded on the live site.


## Loader-free composition and browser verification — 1 October 2026

The active browser engine now uses native static-stock placement with `DSP_LOADER = false`. The dynamic-loader implementation remains available to developers but is excluded from visitor builds. With stock FX2 retained, only Repitch fits. With stock FX2 off, original FX1 effects remain available and selected DSP modules use the three omitted reverb regions (2,724 words per core). Overruns are refused. Tape Echo and Euclid alone require the appended ColdFire runtime and its sample-memory reservation; configurations containing neither leave sample memory unchanged.

The unmodified native builder at `b8deefc88b2c3e5f3c6158e364eb741df1924e1d` exported every subset of the seven pinned modules with both stock-FX2 settings. The JavaScript composer matched all 74 successful complete OS images and all 182 refusals, with zero mismatches across 256 profiles. The exporter also captured native ELEK container and ELUP upgrade identities for all 74 accepted profiles from the same original card file. No composition identities changed when packaging facts were added.

The representative JavaScript packaging pass matched native container and full upgrade lengths and hashes, and round-tripped back to the composed OS for four profiles: Repitch with stock FX2; Mini Verb with stock FX2 off; Character + Mini Verb + Tape Echo with stock FX2 off; and Mini Verb + Tape Echo + Euclid + Repitch with stock FX2 off. The complete original file and decoded OS remained unchanged. Modified-OS, wrong-slot and unsupported-chooser refusals passed. `scripts/verify-static-composition-native.mjs` fails closed on absent, duplicate or missing profiles and absent packaging identities. Its default checks full packaging for all 74 accepted cases; `--packing=representative` checks the four profiles while still checking all 256 OS/refusal cases. The exhaustive JavaScript packing mode was not run in this session.

Two actual production-bundle browser-worker builds matched the same-input native full-file identities:

| Configuration | Stock FX2 | Finished bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Mini Verb | off | 445580 | `612b4e6c441e787421d69f42d7da65927dd5d2485396f40923a35d0c6bdb00e1` |
| Mini Verb, Tape Echo, Euclid, Repitch | off | 560904 | `7fe1016a56cbb853c44c947d08b857fe31e8e3bcd614cad0266a08846b0f7dc5` |

The browser rejected a wrong-size base before accepting the owner's original 1.40C locally. Keeping stock FX2 blocked the four-module selection and explained the effect trade; turning it off enabled validation. Adding Spectrum and Modulation refused the overrun and disabled Build. Acknowledgement was required before building. Cancel/rebuild recovered the worker and completed with the native identity. Changing stock-FX2 settings removed the finished identity and reset acknowledgement. Reload restored and reverified the saved base. A 390-pixel mobile viewport showed no horizontal overflow, including the full fingerprint. Downloads stayed disabled, so clicking and independently hashing a downloaded loader-free file remain required after owner approval.

`npm run check` passed 143 tests in 32 files, four synthetic SDK guard tests, lint, app/server TypeScript and the static production build with Node 24. Synthetic static-placement tests cover both core regions, native stable priority order, split-run first fit, overrun/no-space refusals, overwritten donor entries, NONE and omitted custom module IDs while preserving listed stock dispatch entries. The historical dynamic-loader verifier now explicitly opts into that path; renewed loader-mode parity remains required before ever re-enabling it.

Stock input and generated firmware stayed local; only hashes, layout facts and authored module code are tracked. No firmware, emulator, stress or audio-render suite ran. No hardware qualification or public deployment is claimed by this branch. The other checkout's pending module-version updates were left untouched; if they merge first, rebuild/import version-matched source packages and repeat parity before publishing this branch. Downloads remain paused pending the owner's approval.

## Combined site release — 1 October 2026

Combined the loader-free engine with the parallel changes: four attributed source imports (Analog BD, MIDI Scenes, USB Audio tracks + MAIN/CUE and Scale Quantizer), their exact upstream dependencies, public author names, social preview and compact responsive layout. Spectrum, Modulation and Character are temporarily hidden from the library and refused by the browser session; saved configurations keep their entries. The eight visible modules include four imports whose firmware build status remains pending. Their pages and configurations are available, but mixed or single pending selections are refused before composition.

The isolated stock-free compiler rebuilt the original seven modules at their current versions from source commit `98190bbe4f514899c9f7b2ad49ca5cb1df9f85b2`. All eight compiled packages have identical code and composition facts to the previously parity-verified packages; only version/source metadata changed. The record binds the full SDK inventory, including pending sources, to fingerprint `435b0363eb3f3869a6352f48ffdce2dd8c2ac5518290b1b95146f84ea250eff1`. Pending Python declarations are excluded from the disposable compilation tree and never evaluated. Import and frontend-only stamping independently require the same verified seven-module scope and exact pins.

After integration, native comparison again passed all 256 profiles: 74 byte-identical OS images, 182 matching refusals and zero mismatches. Four representative configurations also matched the native complete container/upgrade and round-tripped. Modified firmware, unsupported chooser and wrong-slot rejections passed. Stock input remained unchanged and no firmware was written. In the combined production bundle's actual browser worker, Mini Verb `0.1.1-experimental` with stock FX2 off again produced 445580 bytes with SHA-256 `612b4e6c441e787421d69f42d7da65927dd5d2485396f40923a35d0c6bdb00e1`.

Browser checks confirmed the new Analog BD detail page and attribution, refusal of a pending Analog BD + Mini Verb selection after local base verification, explicit adoption of updated versions for an older saved configuration, and successful loader-free composition afterwards. The sidebar stayed at viewport height on long module and configuration pages. At 390 pixels the finished identity had no horizontal overflow. The disposable local origin's saved base was removed after checking. Downloads and the dynamic DSP loader remain disabled.

The final Node 24 `npm run check` passed lint, 153 tests in 35 files, seven synthetic SDK guard/import tests, app/server TypeScript and the static production build. Release automation must reproduce these committed packages from the exact owner-merged commit before publishing. This record documents pre-release checks; it does not claim hardware qualification or a completed deployment.
